## Imports:
The code initiates by importing essential libraries such as yfinance, enabling the retrieval of financial data, pandas, facilitating data manipulation and analysis, numpy, providing support for numerical computations, and seaborn, allowing for data visualization. These libraries are fundamental for handling data, implementing trading strategies, and evaluating performance metrics.

## Parameters:
Various parameters are defined to configure the trading strategy, setting crucial values like phi for the anamoly threshold, threshold for anomaly detection, initial_portfolio_value to establish the starting value of the portfolio, and additional parameters such as cool_off_period, trailing_stop_ratio, max_drawdown_limit, and risk_free_rate to fine-tune the strategy's behavior according to specific risk preferences and market conditions.

## Retrieve Stock Data:
The code reads historical Bitcoin price data from a CSV file using pandas, converting it into a structured DataFrame. It calculates essential indicators like moving averages (MA), relative strength index (RSI), and golden ratio bounds to detect anomalies in the data, providing insights into potential trading opportunities.

## Improved Anomaly Detection:
Anomalies in the data, indicative of potential trading signals, are identified based on specific conditions related to moving averages, RSI, and price bounds. These anomalies represent instances where the market behavior deviates significantly from normal patterns, potentially signaling favorable entry or exit points for trades.

## Dynamic Trade Size:
The code computes rolling historical volatility to dynamically adjust the trade size, ensuring that the risk exposure aligns with market conditions. By incorporating volatility into the trade sizing strategy, the code aims to optimize risk management and capitalize on opportunities presented by varying levels of market volatility.

## Trading Strategy Implementation:
The trading strategy, encompassing buy logic, trailing stop loss, and portfolio management, is executed iteratively over detected anomalies. This segment of the code handles the actual buying and selling of assets, as well as the management of the portfolio's composition and value over time.

## Trade History:
Each trade's details, including the buy and sell dates, corresponding prices, returns, portfolio value, and maximum drawdown, are meticulously recorded in a structured format. This trade history log provides a comprehensive record of the strategy's performance, enabling detailed analysis and evaluation.

## Calculating Ratios:
Performance evaluation metrics such as the Sharpe and Sortino ratios are computed to assess the profitability and risk-adjusted returns of the trading strategy. These ratios provide insights into the strategy's risk-adjusted performance, helping to gauge its effectiveness in generating returns relative to the level of risk undertaken.

## Summary Table:
The trade history, along with calculated ratios and trade amounts, is presented in a tabular format for easy interpretation and analysis. This summary table consolidates the key information related to the strategy's performance, enabling users to gain insights into its profitability, risk exposure, and overall effectiveness.
