# Introduction
This Readme aims to provide a summary of our approach using a combination of technical analysis and machine learning algorithms. The approach utilizes various supervised learning models to predict signals based on historical price data and technical indicators.
## Signal Generation
We implemented a moving average crossover strategy, wherein a signal of 1 is generated when the short-term moving average surpasses the long-term moving average, and 0 otherwise.
## Models Used
The following machine learning models are employed in this forecasting project:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier (CART)**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)**
 -**Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (NN)**
- **AdaBoost Classifier (AB)**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier (RF)**
